# Odin Landing Page Project

The Odin Project provided a design and a style guide containing colors and font sizes for a webpage that I needed to clone. The objective was to create a webpage from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3

### What I learned

- Being comfortable using Flexbox, especially with justify-content and align-items.
- Using Chrome Inspector Tool to test various CSS styles before officially adding it to my stylesheet.
- Using Git to add, push, pull, and amend files and commit messages.
- Working on a project starting from top to bottom.
