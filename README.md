### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://hillaryosei.github.io/odin-landing/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to amend git commit messages
- How to use Chrome Inspector Tool to debug and try out different codes before officially adding it on my stylesheet
- How to use flexbox


### Continued development

Throughout the project, I encountered major difficulties with how to appropriately use flexbox. I found myself throwing different alignment properties and values, hoping that something would stick eventually. As I learn more advanced HTML and CSS, I will return to this landing page to update the code and make it cleaner.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me get some understanding of flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone who is learning this concept.
