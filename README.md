## My process

### What I learned

- How to amend git commit messages

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

Throughout the project, I encountered major difficulties with how to appropriately use flexbox. I found myself throwing different alignment properties and values, hoping that something would stick eventually.
